    introParagraphs: [
        "The new year has brought a sharp escalation of tensions on the Korean Peninsula, raising fresh concerns about military action and regional security. It began on January 3rd when Kim Yo-jong, member of the influential State Affairs Commission and sister to North Korea’s supreme leader, issued a mocking rebuke of the government in Seoul. Within days, the North moved from rhetoric to combat rehearsal, firing a 200-round artillery barrage into the sea near two South Korean islands and launching its first test of a solid-fuel intermediate-range ballistic missile. The missile test drew immediate condemnation from the United States for violating multiple U.N. Security Council resolutions.",
        "Despite all that, the biggest bombshell was yet to come.",
        "On January 16th, Pyongyang announced it would officially abandon plans for the reunification of Korea, reversing a decades-long agreement with the South. Speaking before the Supreme People's Assembly, Kim Jong-un called for a constitutional amendment to define South Korea as the North’s “number one enemy” and prioritized the annexation of South Korea in case of war.",
        "Is North Korea preparing for such a war?",
        "Some experts say yes. According to two veteran analysts, former State Department official Robert L. Carlin and nuclear scientist Siegfried S. Hecker, Mr. Kim’s provocations are no mere threats. “Kim Jong-un has made a strategic decision to go to war,” they say.",

Citing interviews with anonymous American officials, the New York Times reports that no concrete signs have been detected that the DPRK is gearing up for combat or a major war. One official cited by the Times said North Korea would not be making large arms shipments to Russia, including new sets of artillery rounds and missiles, if it were planning on a prolonged conflict closer to home.",

    outroParagraphs: [
        "So perhaps full-scale war is not imminent. Surely, Pyongyang’s recent hardline posturing  is consistent with a long held pattern of tactical provocations. Still, South Korea is well advised to remain alert and even expect minor skirmishes ahead, possibly in the Demilitarized Zone or the buffer zone in the West sea. U.S. officials warn that Mr. Kim, after shifting to a policy of open hostility, could conduct some form of lethal military action against South Korea in the coming months, potentially even more serious than the North’s 2010 shelling of Yeonpyeong Island, which left four dead and scores more injured.",
        "Peace activists argue that in order to draw North Korea back to talks, the first step is a halt to all military exercises that strain relations, such as the ROK-US joint military drills. Jonghun Kapsong Kim, director at the Korean American Peace Fund, said “it’s absurd to demand the North cease all military operations that pose a threat to the Korean peninsula at the same time as the R.O.K carries out some of the world’s largest joint military drills with the United States multiple times each year.”",
        "The current trend towards escalation includes ongoing verbal provocation from the South as well, namely from the government of Yoon Suk-yeol, South Korea’s divisive conservative president. “Red scare” McCarthyism remains a powerful political weapon in South Korea, and the nation’s conservative party has traditionally benefited from security issues with the DPRK, especially around election season. South Korea expects to hold National Assembly elections in April.",
        "Since Mr. Yoon took office in 2022, diplomatic policy on the DPRK has grown extremely belligerent, aligning with the US’s “no-tolerance” policy that emphasizes sanctions and isolation. Last October, Defense Minister Shin Won-sik made headlines announcing a new offensive military posture towards DPRK provocations called “PISU: Punish Immediately, Strongly, and Until the end (즉각, 강력히, 끝까지 응징)”.",
        "For many Koreans like Kang Sung-ae, whose husband died in the bombardment of Yeonpyeong Island, all the posturing obscures tragedy. “When my husband died, I wondered if our military should have responded more strongly,” she said in an interview two years after the incident. “But politicians seem to be all similar. It seems like they only listen to us during election season and that’s it once they get elected.”",
        "Ms. Kang’s husband was working on construction of a new residence for the Yeonpyeong Island Marine Corps unit on the day when artillery shells rained down. She knows very well her husband’s death will be forgotten from people's minds as time passes. “It is fortunate that stability has been restored to Yeonpyeong Island, but those of us who suddenly lost our loved ones are still living in tears.”",
