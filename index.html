        <p>Hello and 안녕하세요! My name is Seulgi, I'm a data journalist in Seoul, South Korea. I use data and graphics to tell stories about complex, often misunderstood issues in our society. I got started writing community dispatches, authoring realtime updates on public health protocols. I will be continuing my journey at Columbia University's Graduate program in Data Journalism this fall, graduating in summer 2026.</p>

        <p>In my work you'll find data-driven insights on urgent questions and topics affecting South Korea, like our relationship with the North; the question of representation in our entertainment; and the way history and memory in our literature can shape the Korean future.</p>

        <p>I'm passionate about the current issues affecting all communities in South Korea. I'm drawn to issues which too often remain lost in the shadows. Please contact me at seulgi.jung1109@gmail.com for assignments, appearances, or just to chat!</p>

          <p class="panel">I covered a soaring xenophobic phenomenon in Korea, singularly targeting Korean Chinese, called joseon-jok. I used Selenium to scrape data and Python to refine it. The graph was created with free Javascript source, and ai2html & Scrollama were used for the other graphic Korean translation is available for this piece.</p>

          <p class="panel">I got a hint for this project from a presentaion by Mr. Suh Jae-jeong, a professor in the Department of Politics and International Studies at International Christian University, clearing the North's true intention amid the current security crisis on the Korean peninsula. I used Mapbox Scrollytelling template and added some structural changes using Javascript. Satelite images were gained from Google Earth.</p>

          <p class="panel">In the night of December 3rd of 2024, Yoon Seok-yeol, now impeached, imposed a martial law in an attempt to wrestle the power out of the congress dominated by a majority of the opposition party. The martial law, enforced for the frist time in 45 years, was foiled in two hours by hundreds of citizens who immediately came to the National Assembly Building and protected it from being occupied by the military. I focused on how Korea's bloody past has helped its people save democracy again, even inspiring and empowering beyond the nation. </p>
